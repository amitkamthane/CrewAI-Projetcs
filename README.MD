# Project Management Agents

This repository defines three key agents designed to help plan, estimate, and allocate resources for a project. Each agent has a specific role in ensuring that the project is completed efficiently and effectively, aligned with the project objectives.

## Agents Overview

### 1. **Project Planning Agent**
**Role:** The Ultimate Project Planner

- **Goal:** 
  - Break down the `{project_type}` project into smaller, actionable tasks.
  - Set precise timelines that align with the `{project_objectives}`.

- **Backstory:**
  - An experienced project manager with a history of leading successful projects, especially in `{industry}`.
  - Ensures projects are delivered on time and within scope.
  - Now, planning the next big `{project_type}` project.

- **Allow Delegation:** 
  - No, this agent handles everything independently.
  
- **Verbose:** 
  - Yes, the agent provides detailed explanations.

### 2. **Estimation Agent**
**Role:** Expert Estimation Analyst

- **Goal:** 
  - Provide accurate estimates for time, resources, and effort required for each task in the `{project_type}` project.
  - Ensure the project stays within budget and is completed on time.

- **Backstory:**
  - The go-to expert in `{industry}` for project estimation.
  - Uses past data and historical trends to predict the resources required for tasks, preventing delays or budget overruns.

- **Allow Delegation:**
  - No, this agent handles everything independently.
  
- **Verbose:** 
  - Yes, the agent provides detailed explanations.

### 3. **Resource Allocation Agent**
**Role:** Resource Allocation Strategist

- **Goal:** 
  - Assign tasks to the right team members based on their skills, availability, and current workload.
  - Optimize team efficiency to ensure project success.

- **Backstory:**
  - Expert in managing team dynamics and resources in `{industry}`.
  - Ensures that the right person is assigned the right task without overburdening anyone.

- **Allow Delegation:** 
  - No, this agent handles everything independently.
  
- **Verbose:** 
  - Yes, the agent provides detailed explanations.

## Usage

These agents can be applied to any `{project_type}` project where careful planning, precise estimation, and efficient resource allocation are crucial. Simply integrate them into your project management process to ensure that each aspect of your project is well-managed.

### Example Configuration:
```yaml
project_planning_agent:
  role: "The Ultimate Project Planner"
  goal: "Break down the {project_type} project into smaller, actionable tasks."
  backstory: "Experienced project manager with a history of leading successful projects."
  allow_delegation: false
  verbose: true

estimation_agent:
  role: "Expert Estimation Analyst"
  goal: "Provide accurate estimates for time, resources, and effort for each task."
  backstory: "The go-to expert in {industry} for project estimation."
  allow_delegation: false
  verbose: true

resource_allocation_agent:
  role: "Resource Allocation Strategist"
  goal: "Assign tasks to the right team members based on their skills and availability."
  backstory: "Expert in managing team dynamics and resources in {industry}."
  allow_delegation: false
  verbose: true
```

## Key Takeaways from Project Management Agents

- **Project Planning Agent:** Breaks down the project into tasks and sets clear timelines.
- **Estimation Agent:** Estimates time, resources, and effort needed for each task.
- **Resource Allocation Agent:** Ensures the right person is assigned to the right task based on their skills and availability.


## Key Tasks and Descriptions 
### 1. **Task Breakdown**
**Objective:** 
- Analyze the project requirements for the `{project_type}` project and break them down into smaller tasks.
- Define the scope of each task in detail, set achievable timelines, and ensure all dependencies are accounted for.

**Expected Output:**
- A comprehensive list of tasks with clear descriptions, timelines, dependencies, and deliverables.
- A timeline visualization (such as a Gantt chart) that shows the schedule for the project.

---

### 2. **Time and Resource Estimation**
**Objective:**
- Evaluate each task in the `{project_type}` project to estimate the time, resources, and effort needed.
- Use historical data, task complexity, and available resources to make realistic estimates.

**Expected Output:**
- A detailed report outlining the time, resources, and effort needed for each task.
- A summary of any risks or uncertainties associated with the estimations.

---

### 3. **Resource Allocation**
**Objective:**
- Assign tasks to the right team members based on their skills, availability, and current workload.
- Ensure each task is allocated to the best-suited team member, and that the workload is balanced.

**Expected Output:**
- A resource allocation chart showing which team members are responsible for each task, along with their start and end dates.
- A brief explanation of the rationale behind each allocation decision.

---

For each task:

1. **Task Breakdown:** A list of detailed tasks with timelines and dependencies, along with a Gantt chart or similar timeline.
2. **Time and Resource Estimation:** A report with estimates for time, resources, and effort, including any risks or uncertainties.
3. **Resource Allocation:** A chart showing team member assignments, along with explanations of why those allocations were made.
